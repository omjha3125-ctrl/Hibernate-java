# Qwen Code Context for `/home/recoil/IdeaProjects/untitled1`

## Project Type
This is a **Java Maven project** using **Hibernate ORM** for database interaction with a **PostgreSQL** database. The project is a basic example demonstrating Hibernate setup, entity mapping, and simple data persistence with entity relationships. Detailed explanatory comments have been added to the source code for learning purposes.

## Key Technologies & Frameworks
*   **Language:** Java (Targeting Java 21 as per `pom.xml`)
*   **Build Tool:** Apache Maven
*   **ORM:** Hibernate (Version 7.1.0.Final)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Driver version 42.7.7)
*   **Testing:** JUnit 4 (Dependency included)

## Core Components (with Notes)
1.  **`pom.xml`**: Defines the project metadata (groupId, artifactId, version), Java version (21), and dependencies including Hibernate Core, PostgreSQL driver, and JUnit.
2.  **`entities/Student.java`**: A JPA entity representing a student with a one-to-many relationship to Certificates. Comments explain the class structure, fields, JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@OneToMany`, etc.), and the role of getters/setters for Hibernate.
3.  **`entities/Certificates.java`**: A JPA entity representing a certificate with a many-to-one relationship to Student. Comments explain the class structure, fields, JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.), and the role of getters/setters for Hibernate.
4.  **`hibernate.cfg.xml`**: The Hibernate configuration file. Comments detail database connection properties, Hibernate settings (`show_sql`, `format_sql`, `hbm2ddl.auto`), and entity mappings for both Student and Certificates.
5.  **`org/example/Util/Util.java`**: A utility class implementing a Singleton pattern to manage the Hibernate `SessionFactory`. Comments explain the Singleton design, the purpose of the static block, and the steps involved in configuring and building the `SessionFactory` from `hibernate.cfg.xml`.
6.  **`org/example/StudentService.java`**: A service class that encapsulates data access logic for Student entities. Provides methods for saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting Student entities with proper transaction and session management.
7.  **`org/example/Main.java`**: The main application class. Comments walk through the standard Hibernate workflow: obtaining a `SessionFactory`, opening a `Session`, beginning a `Transaction`, performing operations (saving a `Student` and related `Certificates`), committing the `Transaction`, and properly closing the `Session`. Also demonstrates usage of the StudentService.

## Building and Running
*(Assuming standard Maven practices)*

*   **Build:** `mvn compile` (Compiles source code)
*   **Test:** `mvn test` (Runs tests - currently no tests exist)
*   **Package:** `mvn package` (Compiles, tests, and creates a JAR file in `target/`)
*   **Run:** `mvn exec:java` (if `exec-maven-plugin` is configured) or `java -cp target/<jar-name> org.example.Main`. Ensure the PostgreSQL database `myappdb` is accessible with the credentials in `hibernate.cfg.xml`.

## Development Conventions
*   **Dependencies:** Managed via Maven (`pom.xml`).
*   **Entities:** Defined under `src/main/java/entities` using JPA annotations. Comments added for educational purposes.
*   **Configuration:** Hibernate configuration is in `src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml`. Comments added for educational purposes.
*   **Utilities:** Helper classes like `Util.java` for managing resources (e.g., `SessionFactory`) are placed in a dedicated package.
*   **Service Layer:** Data access logic is encapsulated in service classes like `StudentService.java` for better separation of concerns.
*   **Entry Point:** The `Main.java` class contains the `main` method, demonstrating the application's core logic with detailed comments.
*   **Testing:** Uses JUnit 4, with test files placed under `src/test/java`.

## Custom Commands
* **Command:** `note please`
  * **Purpose:** Revises the codebase for any changes, adds detailed notes as comments to Java and XML files, and updates existing notes if the code flow changes. This is designed to make the codebase self-explanatory for beginners.

* **Command:** `diagram`
  * **Purpose:** Creates or updates a flow.md file explaining the complete work in form of ASCII wireframe diagram. The diagram includes:
    * When each file was created
    * Why each file was created
    * What code or functions each file contains
    * What purpose each file serves in the flow
    * Pseudo example code for quick revision
    * One complete notes file for someone who doesn't want to go through entire files
    * Updates the wireframe diagram according to any changes in flow or code when this command is used
